            <h2>About the game:</h2>
            <p>There are a few reasons I decided to make this game, one of which was to teach how being helpful can boost not only your morale, but also those of the people you help! Another was simply to just introduce people about the concept of Dungeons And Dragons, one of my favourite games! This project was a hobby of mine I made while learning how to properly code in Python, so it may not be the most effecient, but It was very fun making the game!</p>
            <p>Below, I will walk through the premise of the game, along with some of the code!</p>
            <p>The game starts off with Character Creation, where you are presented with a menu to manage your stats, before you start your journey. The stats are calculated based on D&D's stats.</p>
            <img src="media/character-creation.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Theres a bunch of more displays to make a good stat generating experience, and I also made it so that you can randomise your stats if you wish to! I'll put a few pictures below.</p>
            <img src="media/randomness.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Once you're done, youll be dropped into the world, where you can travel in a 11x11 grid for a town, going around and doing quests. your main goal is to raise money for Scouts, and doing so by doing jobs for townspeople. Below are how i managed the quests, in a form of a list, and what you need to do for the quests</p>
            <img src="media/questsystem.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Here, you can move, check your map, inventory, stats, etc. and if you find a stall, you can purchase your items! Below is what the map system looks like, with player tracking as well.</p>
            <img src="media/mapcode.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>As most of this game is hard coded, I made it so that each spot in the town has its own description, introduction to the location, and if there is anything to do at the location, via 3 different randomly generated introduction types.</p>
            <img src="media/intro.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <img src="media/locations.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <p>Once its done, It returns the narration introduction, and the narration.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>I also made a simple combat system, to spice up gameplay to be a real RPG, the code is below</p>
            <img src="media/combat1.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <img src="media/combat2.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <img src="media/combat3.png" alt="Code Segment" width="100%">
            <p>And depending on if you win the fight or lose it, you will be continuing your journey, or spawned back at the Town Hall.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>This code is not perfect however, and I do wish to learn more if I am able to get into this course! I've tried learning C and Java, but never actually got that far into it. thanks for reading!</p>
